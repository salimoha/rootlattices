# rootlattices
The most basic families of lattices are often referred to as root lattices due to their relation to the root systems of Lie algebra denoted $\mathbb{Z}^n$, $D_n$, $A_n$, and $E_n$. The basic matrix for each for these lattices are denoted by $B_{Z^n}$, $B_{D_n}$, $B_{A_n}$, and $B{E_n}$, respectively.
